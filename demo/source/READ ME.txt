Hello, this is Tanks - rstar demo, by Rick Astley

To show some example usages of this library, I made
this little game where you move around in a tank.
The space around you will be filled with a thousand
random boxes, which are the protagonists of the demo.
You can interact with them by colliding and shooting a
bullet on them.
While you have fun roaming around, the game will prompt
on screen some interesting informations:

 - The current number of boxes
 - The number of boxes actually checked for collision detection,
   last time the tank moved
 - The number of boxes being drawn
 - The number of boxes tested to display the target icon, using
   raycasting
 - The number of intersections performed on average by the tree
   in collision detection queries. Includes internal nodes
 - Same as above but to retrieve boxes visible on screen.

Hope you'll like this,
